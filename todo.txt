Success criteria:
X simple piece moves and captures
X en passant
X castling king-side
X castling: moving king and rook correcly
X castling queen-side
X not allowed to castle when already moved
- check
- disallowing moves when checked
- castling when checked
- mate
- stale mate
- pawn promotion
- draw by repetition
- 50 move rule

Technical tasks:
- refactor moves, such that they can be rolled on and off (command with rollback)
- split tests into success criteria tests and unit tests of underlying bits and pieces
