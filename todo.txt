Success criteria - chess engine:
...

Success criteria - other:
- parse simple move notation (e4,e5, Nf3,Nc6, Bb5 etc)
- output possible moves for an input game: for verification
- game setup at specific location, instead of always starting at initial position

Technical tasks:
X refactor moves, such that they can be rolled on and off (command with rollback)
X create PieceMoveGenerators
- create GameMoveGenerator
- split tests into success criteria tests and unit tests of underlying bits and pieces
- refactor tests such that they reuse functionality
